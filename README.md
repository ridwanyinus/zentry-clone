# Zentry Homepage Hybrid Clone

Zentry is the metagameâ€”a unified play layer that bridges players, agentic AI, and blockchains, opening a new world of AI-driven gamification and a cross-sector data economy. This project is a hybrid clone of the Zentry homepage, inspired by [Zentry](https://zentry.com). The goal of this project is to enhance my skills in creating animations and stunning visuals using modern web technologies.

## Overview

This project is a clone of the Zentry homepage, created to practice and improve my skills in front-end development, particularly in animation and visual design. It replicates the design and functionality of the original site while incorporating my own implementation.

## Credits

Some design elements, images, and videos used in this project are sourced from the official [Zentry website](https://zentry.com). This project is for educational and personal practice purposes only.
